# TASK: Generate Similar Strategy Variations

## OBJECTIVE
Generate 5 strategies that use the **same core capabilities** as the example plan but vary the **implementation details**.
You are provided with the original task instruction, an example plan that attempts to satisfy this task instruction, and an image of the initial state before agent execution.

## AGENT CAPABILITIES
- Keyboard typing and shortcuts
- Mouse interactions
- Direct python code execution

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**MUST USE IDENTICAL CAPABILITIES:**
- Use the EXACT SAME capabilities as the example (no substitutions allowed)
- If example uses Python code execution → ALL strategies must use Python code execution
- If example uses mouse clicks → ALL strategies must use mouse clicks
- If example uses keyboard typing/hotkeys → ALL strategies must use keyboard typing/hotkeys
- If example uses a mixture (some keyboard, some Python) -> ALL strategies must use a similar mixture based on your best judgement
- **NEVER replace one capability with another** (e.g., don't replace Python with GUI interactions)

**FORBIDDEN CAPABILITY CHANGES:**
- ❌ Don't replace Python code with mouse/keyboard interactions
- ❌ Don't replace mouse clicks with Python code
- ❌ Don't replace keyboard shortcuts with mouse clicks
- ❌ Don't add new capability types not in the example
- ❌ No terminal opening steps

**ALLOWED VARIATIONS (within same capabilities):**
1. **Technical choices**: Different libraries, methods, parameters when using Python
2. **Execution paths**: Different menu options, shortcuts when using mouse/keyboard
3. **Verification steps**: Different validation approaches using same capability type
4. **Scope**: Single vs batch operations using same approach
5. **Step count**: More/fewer steps but same capability mix

## OUTPUT FORMAT

```
ANALYSIS:
Core Capabilities: [Which capabilities does the example use? Keep these unchanged]
Implementation Variables: [What specific details can be modified?]

Strategy 1:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Continue...]

Strategy 2:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Continue...]

[Continue for 5 strategies total]
