# TASK: Generate Diverse Alternative Strategies

## OBJECTIVE
Generate 10-20 strategies that are **as different as possible** from the provided example strategies. Maximize diversity in both capability use and implementation approaches.
You are provided with the original task instruction, a few example strategies to attempt to be different from, and an image of the initial state before agent execution.


## AGENT CAPABILITIES
- Keyboard typing and shortcuts
- Mouse interactions
- Direct Python code execution (no terminal opening required)

## DIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS

**MAXIMIZE DIFFERENCES FROM EXAMPLES:**
- Use **different capability combinations** than the examples whenever possible
- If examples use mouse → prioritize keyboard or Python approaches
- If examples use Python → prioritize mouse or keyboard approaches
- If examples use keyboard → prioritize mouse or Python approaches
- Explore completely different solution paths and methodologies

**ENCOURAGED VARIATIONS:**
1. **Capability switching**: Different primary capability (mouse ↔ keyboard ↔ Python)
2. **Approach diversity**: Different fundamental methods or workflows
3. **Technical alternatives**: Different tools, libraries, or implementation paths
4. **Interface variations**: GUI vs programmatic vs hybrid approaches
5. **Scope differences**: Single-step vs multi-step, direct vs indirect methods

## MANDATORY ELEMENTS

**EVERY STRATEGY MUST INCLUDE:**
- **Verification steps**: Confirm task completion
- **Popup handling**: Address visible popups (handle or ignore)
- **Complete solution**: Fully accomplish the stated task
- **Ordering**: Most likely to succeed first, least likely last

**CONSTRAINTS:**
- No terminal opening steps (Python executes directly)
- Target 10-20 total strategies
- Each strategy should be actionable and specific
- DO NOT label strategies with numbers (e.g. "Strategy 1", "Strategy 2", etc.). Carefully follow the output format listed below.


## OUTPUT FORMAT

Strategy:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Continue with numbered steps...]
4. [Include verification step]
